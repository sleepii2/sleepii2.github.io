<h1>How Artificial Intelligence affects social media</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing our chosen topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h4>


	<p><h5>Broad topic : Social Media </p></h5>
<p><h5>Sub-topic : Artificial Intelligence </p></h5>
<p><h5>Focus in sub-topic : How AI affects social media</p></h5>

<p>In recent years, the usage of social media has only increased exponentially, and this can be proven as it is forecasted that 3.43 billion people will be active on social media by 2023.
(Statista, B. D. P. 2020.) Social media can be defined as a collective term for websites and applications that focus on communication, community-based input, interaction, content-sharing and collaboration. 
	(Lutkevich & Wigmore, 2021). Furthermore, there are also many recent developments on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence can be defined as the simulation of human intelligence 
	processes by machines, especially computer systems. (Burns et al., 2023) In the past decade, we have seen the implementation  and use of Artificial Intelligence in social media has become abundant which 
	has led us to investigate the effect of artificial intelligence in social media.</p>

<p>In our opinion, we believe that due to the widespread usage of social media worldwide, artificial intelligence will affect a large number of social media users. The pros and cons that artificial 
	intelligence in social media brings will directly or indirectly affect the users of social media. Therefore, we have decided to further investigate how Artificial Intelligence affects social 
	media in order for us to obtain a better understanding on how this technology can be further improved, or the good qualities that we can retain that will bring benefits to our society as a whole. </p>
