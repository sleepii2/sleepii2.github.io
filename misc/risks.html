<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
	
<h5><p>Risks:</p></h5>
	
	<p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into social media platforms comes with certain risks that should be taken into consideration. While AI can bring many benefits to social media, 
		such as personalised content and improved user experiences, it also raises concerns related to privacy, biases, misinformation, and social manipulation.</p> 
	
	<p>To touch on some of these risks, we’ll start with privacy concerns. Some AI powered social media systems rely on user data to train their algorithms in order to present the user very 
		specific and personalised experiences. Because data is so significant for companies in order to create models that make better predictions, this can raise concerns because sensitive 
		user information could possibly be collected, stored and potentially misused or compromised. (Manheim, K., & Kaplan, L. 2019)</p>
	
	<p>Because of AI-created content being able to produce publishing content at ridiculous speeds, this is targeted by most news platforms as a new way to generate 100’s of articles daily 
		(Cloudy, J., Banks, J., & Bowman, N. D. 2021). Similar AI algorithms employed by social media platforms have the potential to display bias, which can result in unjust treatment 
		or discrimination. This is known as algorithmic bias, in cases where these algorithms are inadequately designed or trained, they might unintentionally magnify existing biases 
		present within the data. Consequently, this can lead to unequal content distribution, discriminatory targeting, or biased decision-making procedures.</p>
	
	<p>Lack of transparency and accountability is another risk that stems from AI algorithms making decisions which us as users might not exactly understand. It’ll make it difficult for 
		users to differentiate whether or not this was the result of the social media platform itself, or the algorithm and whether or not the social media platform can be held accountable 
		for any concerning actions due to biased content, moderation of harmful content, manipulation and the privacy concerns. (Lopez, A., & Garza, R. 2023)</p>
	
	<p>By removing a human moderation, this could lead to cyberbullying and harassment. Although the wide variety of content being shared around all social media platforms leads to a nearly 
		impossible task of moderating them all as humans. This leads to the implementation of AI powered moderation, and such AI powered moderation can still struggle to effectively address 
		cyberbullying, hate speech and harassment. Automated moderation algorithms will sometimes get it wrong, and without human interaction can be read out of context or misunderstood 
		through what AI has learnt, situations such as the use of irony and sarcasm can be hard to decipher for algorithmic learning approaches, or abusive words and derogatory terms can 
		slip passed AI moderation (Milosevic, T., Van Royen, K., & Davis, B. 2022). This could lead to cyberbullying and harassment situations/actions bypassing not only the ‘cyberbullying’ 
		aspect of moderation in social media but also other aspects of moderation including the main topic, misinformation and fake news.</p>
	
	<p>Specifically for our chosen topic, misinformation and fake news is one of the biggest risks in relation to Artificial Intelligence in Social Media. AI systems have the potential to 
		unintentionally propagate false information and deceptive news quickly. Bots and AI algorithms can be intentionally programmed to distribute misleading or inaccurate data, manipulate 
		public sentiment, and intensify divisive content. As a result, this can foster the dissemination of disinformation, potentially causing social instability. A recent study on facebook 
		as a social network explains how an increasing number of users are relying on social media to present them current news and how this has proven to be difficult in disseminating fake 
		news because of how ‘online news’ and its presentation has changed drastically(Wu, L., Morstatter, F., Carley, K. M., & Liu, H. 2019). The study follows an investigation into facebook 
		and how it may spread misinformation, and how it fails to differentiate what users’ feeds get. Hence, legitimate news will appear exactly the same as fake news.</p>
	
	<p>In conclusion, AI integration in social media has brought significant benefits but also poses challenges with misinformation and fake news. AI algorithms, driven by speed and data, enable 
		the rapid spread of false information. They prioritize sensational content and reinforce existing beliefs, creating filter bubbles and confirmation bias. Malicious actors can exploit 
		AI vulnerabilities to manipulate public opinion. To address this, we must strive for responsible AI use. Social media platforms, policymakers, researchers, and users must collaborate 
		to prioritize accuracy, transparency, and fact-checking. Improving AI capabilities and promoting media literacy are crucial steps towards a trustworthy online environment.</p>
