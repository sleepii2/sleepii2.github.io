	<h5><p>Opportunities:</p></h5>
	<p>It is evident that Artificial Intelligence(AI) holds a critical role in social media. AI has various functionalities which enhance the usage of social media. It brings multiple benefits 
		to different parties that are involved in social media such as the corporations, government agencies and the users themselves.</p> 
	
	<p>The very first benefit of AI in social media is that it helps corporations or businesses with digital marketing. Marketing has evolved over the years from handing out flyers and putting up posters to putting on 
		advertisements on websites or social media applications. This evolution of marketing can further be seen as Facebook pages have more than 50 million registered businesses and over 88 % of businesses 
		use Twitter for their marketing purposes (Lister, 2017). Furthermore, with the introduction of AI to social media, digital marketing has become as easy and efficient as ever. 
		This is because AI can help companies lower their cost of digital marketing and also ensure that their target audience for their marketing is reached.</p>
	<p>Firstly, AI can help businesses lower their marketing costs with the usage of ‘chatbots’ in their website or application. These ‘chatbots’ can automatically answer simple or frequently asked questions 
		by customers. An example of chatbots being used is that Facebook Messenger has 30,000 “bots” that answer messages from members of groups or subscribers to pages. 
		This is also the same for Twitter.(Kerguignas, 2020, p. 14). Thus, companies are able to reduce the resources used in this aspect and more efficiently allocate their resources to other aspects of 
		the business that need more attention from employees.</p>
	
	<p>Moreover, AI can help companies more easily identify and decide on which influencers they want to work with in order to advertise their products or brand to their target consumers. With the use of AI, 
		companies can evaluate an influencer’s content and interactions with social media users to further determine the influence and rate of responses from consumers.(Shrestha et al., 2019, p. 71). 
		Thus, companies can accurately pinpoint which influencers they should collaborate with in order to advertise their products to the right audience. </p>
	
	<p>Another benefit of AI in social media is that it can efficiently and quickly publish news on social media. For example, AI can create multiple templates for the same news and continue to report 
		on that news from different perspectives such as making tweets, headlines or summaries of that particular news incident.(Pedada et al., 2019, p. 10).  In addition, AI can also be used to 
		generate and publish a news report on social media if something that has news value emerges.(Hassan, A. 2021).Lastly, many companies also take advantage of the large amount of data available 
		to use AI to aid them in researching topics to create journalistic articles and also publish content on social media. 
		Hofeditz, L., Mirbabaie, M., Holstein, J., & Stieglitz, S. (2021, June).With the help of AI, news can quickly and efficiently be published on social media, and social media users from all over 
		the world can be updated on the latest news as soon as possible. </p>
